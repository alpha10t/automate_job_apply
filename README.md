# automate_job_apply
This program applies for jobs on your behalf. You can run schedules runs everyday to automate applying for jobs on naukri.com


Note: User credentials needs to be changed. I have removed my own account.

Needs Improvements
1) Keep a log of all the jobs that needs to be applied using manual methods.
2) Need to handle exceptions. The program is straightforward with no methods to handle timeouts or network interruptions.
3) Show have capabilities to run checks on the kept log files and remove them to apply
4) Should max out at 40 job applies per day
